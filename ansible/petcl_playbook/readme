The playbook was created to run an application on a server with a remote database as an applications backend.
  With this playbook Ansible retrieves pre-built app from Google Cloud storage on a server. To provision a remote MySQL database
  as a backend for an app the Cloud SQL Proxy is used. To make an app running continuously both app and proxy are made the 
  systemd processes.
